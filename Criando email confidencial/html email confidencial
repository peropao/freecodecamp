    <p>Dear Agent S'more,</p>

    <div id="confidential"><h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2></div>
    

  <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <span class="blurred">Mega Marshmallow</span>has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
  <p>We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to <span class="blurred">infiltrate the lab</span> and secure the formula before it's too late.</p>
  
  <p>Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
